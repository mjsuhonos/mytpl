MyTPL - Location-aware Mobile Search using PHP-YAZ and IUI

About
-----
MyTPL is a proof-of-concept web application that uses PHP-YAZ to search
a Z39.50 catalogue interface, translates the responses using XML/XSLT,
and presents the results in a mobile UI using the IUI toolkit.  It uses
the HTML Geolocation Javascript API to provide nearest-copy functionality.

A demonstration instance is maintained (without guarantee) at http://mytpl.ca
but the code is available to any developer looking to integrate these features
with their own library.
